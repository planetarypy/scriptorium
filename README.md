# Scriptorium

This PlanetaryPy repository is not a focused library, but a collection
of scripts useful for work related to Planetary Sciences.  

## Use a script

You may find something here useful, and if so, feel free to clone
the whole repo, or just click on one and hit the "Raw" button and
then "Download" or "Save As" the resulting plain text version of
the Python program.


## Providing a script

If you have a Python script that you think others might find useful,
please [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) to the Scriptorium!

The concept here is that while the PlanetaryPy Project welcomes
submission of full-up Python [Packages](https://planetarypy.org/packages/),
there are lots of valid bits of Python that are more atomic.
One-offs, singletons, or other little bits and bobs that maybe
you've written are all valuable, and might help someone else.

So do your colleagues a service today, and contribute that script!

If you have more than a single Python file, but less than a whole
package, you can also contribute a directory of Python files (that
presumably all work together).


## Scope

As part of the PlanetaryPy project, this Scriptorium is meant for
Planetary-relevant Python scripts.  General-purpose Python scripts
aren't really appropriate, but if you're not sure: contribute it
anyway, and we can have a discussion about whether something is
appropriate or not.
